I'm a PhD Student in Mechanical Engineering in the [Center for Modeling, Simulation, & Imaging in Medicine (CeMSIM)](https://cemsim.rpi.edu/) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. My research focuses in neuroimaging and physiological sensing to precisely assess motor-skills in end-to-end fashion, through robust AI-based modelling. I have a **5-year experience** leveraging statistical and **SoTA AI techniques for time-series data**, including wavenet, BERT-based foundation models, unsupervised algorithms, LoRA and others.

My current research aims to assess surgical trainees' dexterity and cognitive skills more accurately, eliminating both human biases and the need to tailor domain-specific data for clinical applications. I am advised by Prof. [Suvranu De](https://eng.famu.fsu.edu/about/engineering-dean-suvranu-de), collaborating closely with Prof. [Rahul](https://faculty.rpi.edu/rahul-rahul) and Prof. [Lora Cavuoto](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/industrial-systems/people/faculty-directory.host.html/content/shared/engineering/industrial-systems/profiles/faculty/cavuoto-lora.detail.latest-news.html).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.test

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
